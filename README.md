CONTENTS:
This directory contains a software implementation of the game, Line Of Action.

"Lines of Action is a board game invented by Claude Soucie. It is played on a checkerboard with ordinary checkers pieces. The two players take turns, each moving a piece, and possibly capturing an opposing piece. The goal of the game is to get all of oneâ€™s pieces into one group of pieces that are connected."

	
	Makefile		A makefile that will compile your
				files and run tests.  You must turn in a Makefile,
				'make' must compile all your files, and 
				'make check' must perform all your tests.  
				Currently, this makefile is set up to do just 
				that with our skeleton files.  Be sure to keep 
				it up to date.
